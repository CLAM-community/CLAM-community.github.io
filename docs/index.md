# COMMUNITY_NAME

> COMMUNITY_NAME is a space where researchers and students to exchange ideas and discuss research in Lagrangian Modelling and Analysis. Most of our expertise is in Ocean science - but we'd love to have you as part of the community if you have different expertise!

## What is Zulip?

!!! note
    
    New to Zulip? The best way to discover it is just to have a
    poke around the space! Introduce
    yourself, message in the `sandbox` channel to test out
    the messaging syntax, or read the ["Getting Started" documentation](https://zulip.com/help/getting-started-with-zulip).

Zulip is an online platform that we use for the COMMUNITY_NAME. It is similar to Slack or Discord, but has the following benefits:

- **Rich messaging syntax**: Messaging on Zulip has support for LaTeX, code blocks, polls, and more.
- **Feature rich**: Zulip provides many integrations with other services, allowing us to easily set up video conferencing or integrate with 3rd party platforms like GitHub
- **Value aligned**: Zulip is open source software, and they have a generous cloud hosting option for academic communities. Zulip is also [GDPR compliant](https://zulip.com/help/gdpr-compliance).

Many communities such as [Conda Forge](https://conda-forge.zulipchat.com/) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.zulipchat.com) are already on Zulip!

!!! note

    This community was formed in 2025 after the [Parcels 10 Year event](https://parcels-code.org/blog/10year-event)
    which made it clear there is a need for such an online space to facilitate
    our science. As a result, the current governance structure has many members 
    of the Parcels team. We value diversity - we would love to have your input  discussing ideas
    to improve the community (event suggestions, community organisation and - as this space matures) promote more
    diversity in ideas and diversity in governance, so that we can be more 
    representative of the community.
