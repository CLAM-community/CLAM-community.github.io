!!! note

    This community was formed in 2025 after the [Parcels 10 Year event](https://parcels-code.org/blog/10year-event)
    which made it clear there is a need for such an online space to facilitate
    our science. As a result, the current governance structure has many members 
    of the Parcels team. We value diversity - we would love to have your input  discussing ideas
    to improve the community (event suggestions, community organisation and - as this space matures) promote more
    diversity in ideas and diversity in governance, so that we can be more 
    representative of the community.
