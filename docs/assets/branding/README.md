# Branding assets

## Colour Palette

TODO (CLAM doesn't yet have a full colour palette)

## Logos

Different variants of the CLAM logo are provided which are suitable on both light and dark backgrounds. You can see these in the `svg` folder (these are the "source of truth" assets). **Make sure to re-generate the pngs when making changes to the SVGs**.

## Re-generating PNG assets from SVG

You can find the PNG assets in the `png` folder.

These are automatically generated from the `svg` assets using `pixi run python convert-png.py` when cd'ed into this folder. You need to have [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/dev/) installed.
