# COMMUNITY_NAME Community Code of Conduct

COMMUNITY_NAME is dedicated to creating a welcoming, supportive and diverse
community around Langrangian modelling and analysis science and software.

We are building the COMMUNITY_NAME community in a way that promotes fairness
and justice for all, with a particular focus on supporting those from
traditionally marginalized / under-represented groups. We want every member of
our community to thrive; we want to make a positive impact on our community
members' work and on the work of others.

## What this code of conduct defines

Our Code of Conduct defines expected behaviour
and guidelines that help create such a community.

Anyone who participates in a COMMUNITY_NAME activity either online or in person is expected to show respect and courtesy to others in all interactions. These interactions may occur in a variety of locations including:

* in GitHub repositories
* in our Zulip community (including direct messages)
* during in-person events,
* when representing COMMUNITY_NAME in public,
* or in any event online or in person where COMMUNITY_NAME is leading the event.

To make sure that everyone has a common understanding of “show respect and courtesy to each other,” we have adopted the following code of conduct. The code of conduct is enforced by COMMUNITY_NAME Moderators as well as the Steering Council.

## Unacceptable behaviour

The following types of behaviour are unacceptable in COMMUNITY_NAME spaces, both online and in-person, and constitute code of conduct violations.

### Abusive behaviour

**Harassment:** including offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion, as well as sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual or romantic attention.

**Threats:** threatening someone physically or verbally. For example, threatening to publicize sensitive information about someone’s personal life.

### Unwelcoming behaviour

#### Blatant acts and micro-aggressions
Blatant micro-aggressions involve making statements that assume
negative characteristics in a blanket fashion because of someone's identification
with a particular group. We take micro-aggressions seriously,  especially
important when they target traditionally marginalized groups (e.g.,
explicitly racist, sexist, homophobic, or transphobic statements).

 > For example, arguing that some people are less intelligent because
 > of their gender, race, religion.

#### Repeated, subtle and unintentional micro-aggressions
Subtle acts of aggression refer to small, unintentionally harmful
mistakes made in conversation. These acts are not necessarily a code of conduct
violation when made by mistake.

However, repeating something after it has been pointed out to you that you
broke a social rule, or antagonizing or arguing with someone who has pointed
out your micro-aggression is considered unwelcoming behaviour, and is not
allowed in the COMMUNITY_NAME community.

#### Maliciousness towards other community members
Maliciousness towards other community members: deliberately attempting to
make others feel bad, name-calling, singling out others for derision or
exclusion. For example, telling someone they’re not a real programmer or that
they don’t belong at COMMUNITY_NAME. If somebody makes such a statement without
malice, they may still be in violation of the Code of Conduct if their actions
are deemed especially/repeatedly unpleasant (see below).

Being especially or repeatedly unpleasant: for example, if we’ve received
reports from multiple COMMUNITY_NAME users, team members, or collaborators of
agitating, rude, or especially distracting behaviour over an extended period of
time.


## Scope in which the COMMUNITY_NAME code of conduct is applied

COMMUNITY_NAME community members are held to the standards outlined in this
code of conduct when interacting in the COMMUNITY_NAME Zulip or GitHub
repositories, when interacting in-person at events where they could
represent COMMUNITY_NAME (this is most professional events), in physical spaces
or with other COMMUNITY_NAME team members or collaborators.

In addition, the COMMUNITY_NAME community and experience often extends outside
those spaces—COMMUNITY_NAME community members may go on walks together to get
lunch, attend meetups or conferences as a group, communicate on social
media, or interact with each other in other communities.

Abusive or unwelcoming behaviour between community members still has a
profound impact on individuals and on the community when it happens beyond
our walls. The COMMUNITY_NAME code of conduct stewards will
use our discretion when deciding how to respond to reports of such behaviour and how to proceed with enforcement. Enforcement may include removing someone from the COMMUNITY_NAME community. We will take into account the
impact on the individual community members involved as well as the impact
on the community at large.

!!! NOTE
    
    When in doubt, please report unacceptable behaviour to us. If someone's behaviour make you feel unsafe within the COMMUNITY_NAME space, we want to support and help you.

## Enforcement

We’ve categorized unacceptable behaviour into abuse and unwelcoming behaviour in the section above.

### Enforcement related to abusive behaviour

We do not tolerate abusive behaviour at COMMUNITY_NAME.
If we witness or receive a report of abusive behaviour, we will
contact the perpetrator to have a conversation with them and verify
what has transpired.

We will follow this response protocol:

If we verify abusive behaviour:

* They will be removed from the COMMUNITY_NAME community
<!-- * If applicable, their employment with COMMUNITY_NAME will be terminated. -->
* Their Zulip account will be deactivated, and
* Permissions will be removed from any COMMUNITY_NAME-related repositories and/or accounts.

The person will not be welcome in any physical or digital spaces covered by the COMMUNITY_NAME Code of Conduct.

### Enforcement related to unwelcome behaviour
If we verify unwelcome, but non-abusive behaviour, we will have a
conversation with the person about their behaviour. The goal of the conversation will be to ensure that they understand the expectation that they not repeat the behaviour or other behaviors that would violate the Code of Conduct a second time.

### Response protocol steps
The COMMUNITY_NAME Moderators and Steering Council will use the steps
below to respond to reports of code of conduct violations.

1. The report will be read carefully
2. We will followup with the person who reported the violation
3. We will followup with the community member whose behaviour was reported as violating the code of conduct

Based upon the above steps, we will to determine whether there has been a code
of conduct violation

## Reporting code of conduct violations

If you see a violation of our code of conduct, [please report it to our
COMMUNITY_NAME Code of Conduct Stewards using this form.](https://forms.gle/7MR7tCpDuprtStWP9)
This is a short Google Form that will be sent to any Executive Council member
acting as a Code of Conduct Steward (see below for details). Alternatively, if
you wish to report to one of the Code of Conduct stewards specifically, email
them directly.

### Current Moderators and Steering Council members
Moderators and members of the Steering Council are visible on the home page of the COMMUNITY_NAME website. You can contact them either via Zulip or via the contact details listed on the website.


###  Why should I report code of conduct violations?

* You are a part of the COMMUNITY_NAME community. Everyone in this community has a shared responsibility for making COMMUNITY_NAME a safe and comfortable space. The COMMUNITY_NAME Team and Executive Council members are active in the community, but given our communities size and the number of online spaces that we manage, it is easy to miss an incident that violates of code of conduct. We thus need your help to enforce the code of conduct.

* The consequences to our community, of not reporting bad behaviour outweigh the consequences for one person of reporting it. We sometimes hear “I don’t want X person to face consequences because I told someone about their bad behaviour.” You were likely not the only one impacted by this even. Consider the potential impact on others if this behaviour continues! We thank you in advance for reporting it to us.

* COMMUNITY_NAME is an open, participatory, community-driven community. Our community depends upon shared trust between community members. Reporting code of conduct violations helps us identify when this trust is broken. Your report helps us prevent the behaviour from happening again.

## Code of conduct related notes

### When to seek help immediately
Instead of filling out a code of conduct violation report, please contact law enforcement directly to report criminal activity (e.g. physical assault, sexual assault, theft), or to report a dangerous physical situation (e.g. fire, serious injury, fear that someone will hurt themselves or someone else).
